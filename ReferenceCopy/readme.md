# Reference Copy

This is a reference copy of the web app, as it was running, on the demo server. When all the stages of coding are done, the final stage product by the student should at least match this reference copy. 

note : rest of the readme and all the other documentation are just a copy of the main web app, on the day, this copy was made. 

# Bari Basics Programming Web App

This app is the ultimate and final project of the ongoing tutorials and learning community at [baribasic.com](https://baribasic.com/).

You can see it in action here - https://baribasicswebappjune23rd2020.azurewebsites.net
