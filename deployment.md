# deployment

There are many ways to deploy a web app. I usually setup a CICD azure pipeline to do deployments. 

For the sake of simplicity, and for beginners, i prefer to deploy web apps directly from visual studio code to a web app service in Azure. It's easier if I show this in a video, how to do it.

Just watch [our video here]().

note : this steps assumes that you already have a azure account configured by you.
